# Android Deployment

- Target API: 31 (Android 12-13)
- Minimum API: 21 (Android 5+) : Lollipop
- Permissions: INTERNET,WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- Status: DEBUG
- Framework: Kivy
- API: PyJnius

Note: 

This is highly experimental and NOT recommended. I don't know shit about the 
Android API, and it will take a long time and lots of commits (probably 1000+) to 
get it working and look like an actual good application.
