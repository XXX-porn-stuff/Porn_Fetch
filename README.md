# Android Deployment

I don't know if I am just too stupid or if someone above the universe just doesn't want me to get this stupid file chooser thing working, but it doesn't work.

It doesn't work with the documentation, It doesn't work with ChatGPT, It doesn't work with ANYTHING

(Ah yeah I forgot, on Linux it OF COURSE works instantly, but Android NOPE.) Imagine just having a system like iOS, but without this stupid company "Apple" (aka Hurensoh) behind it...


- Target API: 31 (Android 12-13)
- Minimum API: 21 (Android 5+) : Lollipop
- Permissions: INTERNET,WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- Status: DEBUG
- Framework: Kivy
- API: PyJnius

Note: 

This is highly experimental and NOT recommended. I don't know shit about the 
Android API, and it will take a long time and lots of commits (probably 1000+) to 
get it working and look like an actual good application.
